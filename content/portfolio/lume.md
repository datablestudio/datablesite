Lüme is an electronically infused clothing collection which integrates dynamic, user customizable elements driven wirelessly from a common mobile phone.  The design and engineering of the collection is focused on the integration of electronics in such a way that they could be easily removed or embedded when desired, thus creating pieces that are easy to wash and care for.  The initial objective for the collection was to create a series of garments that could adapt to the users daily life, changing in color depending on the event, location, mood, or even just to match another garment or accessory. The garments also can respond to sound, if the user pleases to select this option within the phone application.  The laser cut piece within each garment can also be customized, to another pattern (other than damask pattern), such as polka dots, flowers, lines, etc.  The entire mini collection when the electronics are not utilized, are simple black everyday garments, giving the wearer multi-use garments, for multiple looks.  A true blend of fashion and technology.
